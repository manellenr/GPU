# GPU

The main goal of this project was to either use an existing C script or write one from scratch, then adapt it for a GPU to compare the performance between the CPU and GPU in terms of execution time. I implemented the QuickSort algorithm on the CPU and then rewrote it for the GPU, focusing on optimizing the GPU code to improve its efficiency.
